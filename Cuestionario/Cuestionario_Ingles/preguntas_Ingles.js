    questionParrafo: "If you are planning a holiday in another country, you should pay     attention to body language across cultures. In the world of travel you     may have uncomfortable moments if you give wrong messages. For     example, in the Middle East, it is very unkind to show the under-side of     ones foot in another persons direction - so crossing your legs while     sitting is a bad idea. People from Pakistan move their head from side to     side to mean “youre welcome”, or “hello”. Moving your hand from side     to side is understood by Indians as “no” or “go away”. In Nigeria, you     mustnt use your left hand to give or receive things. This hand is considered dirty. The Maori of New     Zealand press noses together and shout to say hello.\n\n You can also see body language differences in the personal space people need when having a     conversation. In South America, this space is often small. People stand very close to each other     to talk, except when they meet for the first time or are at the office. In the United States this space     becomes much larger; people are not as comfortable when others stand close to them,     especially when they do not know each other very well. Others whose personal space is small are     the Arabs, French and Italians, while the Germans and Japanese need more.\n",

    questionParrafo: "There are certain points to consider before you decide to get a cat. First of all, be prepared to     spend time with your cat. Although cats dont have a closer relationship with humans than     most other pets, they still require attention and care. Cats have their own different characters     and their own special habits and choices. It is a good idea to prepare yourself with some basic     knowledge about cats before you get one.\n\n As distant as they may be, cats really love to play. But cats usually dont fetch like dogs; dont just throw a ball to your    cat and expect it to be entertained. Cats like to be spoiled by humans. They like to have “communication” with you.     Spend time playing and having contact with your cat.\n\nCats show their love to you not only through making their typical sounds, but also by touching your arms, legs, or     another part of your body. If you are new to cats and you don´t know this, you may think they want to hurt you. However,     it is just friendly play.\n\n They probably love to see what is going on around them more than other pets. They do this by jumping to high places    like a sofa, cupboard, or table to keep an eye on you and what you´re doing.\n\nCats love to have sharp nails, so buying a cushion for your cat will keep your furniture safe. In order to avoid any damage,     keep your cat´s nails short and train it to use the cushion. This will save you money and lots of headaches in the future.",
